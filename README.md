## KELP

### KELP - Karma Enhanced Link Protector
KELP (Karma Enhanced Link Protector) is an advanced browser extension developed to enhance web browsing security by protecting users from harmful or malicious links. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of its features and functionality:

Real-Time Scanning
KELP operates by continuously monitoring the links that users encounter while browsing the internet. This real-time scanning capability ensures that every link is evaluated immediately as it is accessed. The system checks for various indicators of danger, such as known phishing sites, malware, or other forms of cyber threats. This proactive approach helps to prevent users from inadvertently clicking on malicious links that could compromise their security.

Karma System
One of the standout features of KELP is its unique karma system. This system assigns a reputation score to each link based on a combination of historical data and real-time analysis. Factors that influence the karma score include:

User Feedback: Links that have been reported by other users as safe or dangerous contribute to the overall karma score. This crowdsourced feedback ensures that the system remains up-to-date with the latest threat intelligence.
Behavioral Analysis: KELP analyzes the behavior of websites, looking for suspicious activities such as unusual redirections, excessive pop-ups, or attempts to access sensitive information without user consent.
Cross-Referencing with Databases: The extension cross-references links with established databases of known malicious sites and phishing attempts. This helps in quickly identifying and flagging dangerous URLs.
Enhanced User Experience
KELP integrates seamlessly with popular web browsers, providing a smooth and user-friendly experience. Users are alerted through clear notifications whenever they encounter a link that poses a potential threat. These alerts include information about why the link was flagged, enabling users to make informed decisions about whether to proceed or avoid the link.
